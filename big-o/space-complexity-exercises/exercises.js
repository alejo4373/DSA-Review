// For the following questions after arriving to a solution
// Ask yourself and answer in comments above your solution:
// What are other input cases that you should try your solution with?
// What is the time complexity?
// What is the space complexity?
// What is n for this particular question?
// Why is it O(n) or other time/space complexity? 
// What is the worst and best input case how does that relate to time/space complexity?
// Can it be done more efficient? Reduce the time or space complexity? What are the tradeoffs?

// Write a function that finds the unique character in a string
// Input: "ppiizaa", Output: "z"
// Input: "abcdeabcdoe", Output: "o"
// Time Complexity: ???
// Space complexity: ???
